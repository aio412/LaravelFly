AsgardCMS Platform  is a modular multilingual CMS built with Laravel 5. http://asgardcms.com/

## config/app.php
add the ServiceProvider to the providers array
```
'Modules\Core\Providers\AsgardServiceProvider',
```

## config/laravelfly.php
1 add its ServiceProvider name to the `providers_in_request` array
```
Modules\Core\Providers\AsgardServiceProvider::class,
```

2 in the `services_to_make_in_worker` array ,make sure `paths` and `views` under `view.__obj__.finder` are uncommented.
```
'view' => [
    '__obj__' => [
         'finder' => [
              'paths',
              'views',
        ],
    ],
],
```
By default, Asgard frontend and backend use different Themes. It's necessary to backup them.

## asgard/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php 
comment this line:
```
		if ($this->app->environment() == 'local') {
			$this->app->register('Barryvdh\Debugbar\ServiceProvider');
		}
```
If you'd like to use Debugbar, please follow the steps in [Debugbar.md](Debugbar.md)

## Final
All of AsgardCms services are hard to registered or booted when swoole worker is starting. So AsgardCms can't use LaravelFly power. I use AsgardCms to test Laravel services.
